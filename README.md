# Magento 2 Development Environment Docker

This is my development docker for Magento 2. It's mostly built on Bitnami containers and uses PHP-FPM instead of mod_php like most other setups, so the PHP container is easily swappable.

I'm not a DevOp a lot of this is built by trial and error.

**DO NOT USE UNLESS YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING! BECAUSE I DON'T!**
